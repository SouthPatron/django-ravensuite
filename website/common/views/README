	This is reponsible for:

		. Implementing the POST and GET method hooks.
		. Has overriding methods to retrieve the object list and
			any relevant extra data required for the template.
		. Allows for the creation of objects with the POST method. For this
			the inheritting classes must override a create method:
				
				create_object_<format>( self, request, data, *args, **kwargs )

			eg:
				create_object_html( self, request, data, *args, **kwargs )

	Objects available to template:

		. extra - as defined by get_extra()
		. object_list - as defined by get_object_list()
		. kwargs - as extracted from URL parser.

	Notable methods:

		. get_extra() - to be overridden by inheritting classes.
		. get_object_list() - to be overriden by inheritting classes.
		. create_object_<format>() - called if a POST is received.

			the PUT handler.
		. DELETE - Delete the object
		. Handles updating of the object if the overridden method of the
			form is present:

			eg:
				update_object_json( self, request, obj, data, *args, **kwargs )


	Objects available to template: (get)
